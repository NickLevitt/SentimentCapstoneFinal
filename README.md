## Nicholas Levitt - College of Charleston Bachelors of Science in Data Science Capstone
### May 2016

This project set out to try and build a predictive model for sentiment analysis for application on fictional literature. 

Using a collection of different machine learning algorithms trained on a pre-labeled dataset, the emotional landscapes of different works of fiction were generated in a graphical format.
